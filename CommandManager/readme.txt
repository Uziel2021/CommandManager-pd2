Notes:
	Requires SuperBLT to work.
	All Commands can be executed with either of the next prefixes: ! / .
	If you want to  add your own chat commands, edit the CustomCommands.lua file, don't touch the lua files in /base/ folder at all.
	Use /list to get a list of commands, Use /help command_name to get the command description and /example command_name to show an example of that command.


Instalation:
	move the CommandManager folder inside your BLT mods folder.
